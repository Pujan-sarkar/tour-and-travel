## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is divided into two main parts:

### 🖥️ Frontend (React)

Located in the `/frontend` folder, the frontend is built using `React` and `React Router` for client-side routing.

Key Dependencies:
- React `^18.3.1`
- React Router DOM `^6.26.2`
- Axios `^1.7.7` for HTTP requests
- Auth0 React `^2.2.4` for authentication

You can find the frontend project files inside the `src/` folder, which is structured as follows:
- `/components`: Reusable UI components.
- `/screenPages`: Different pages for the app, such as signup, login, etc.

### ⚙️ Backend (Node.js & Express)

The backend code is located in the `/Backend` folder and is built using `Node.js` with `Express` to manage the API endpoints.

`Key Dependencies:`
- Express `^4.21.0`
- Mongoose `^8.6.2` for MongoDB connection
- JWT `^9.0.2` for authentication tokens
- Bcrypt `^5.1.1` for password hashing
- Cors `^2.8.5` for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

The backend contains various folders for organizing the code:
- `/Routers`: Define API routes.
- `/models`: Mongoose schemas for database models.
- `/middleware`: Authentication and other middleware.
- `/config`: Configuration files (e.g., environment variables).
```
